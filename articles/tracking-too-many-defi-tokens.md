The problem is it is difficult to integrate different tokens into metamask all the time. Therefore, if I transfer my cryptos to a different token, it is not shown in metamask, until they integrate, causing a feeling of paradox. This can be solved by a one-stop portfolio tracking service, like Instadapp, or Zapper but still a problem to link all the cryptos together.

For devs, developers get the ability to rapidly scale their product offerings by connecting to an already existing lending protocol(faster, but less customizable) or building lending infra(slower but more customizable)
Two kinds of people:
1. Extender: PM who wants to extend the value of company by shipping new products faster, by simply integrating with pre-existing solutions
2. Hunter: Dev who works on solving a particular pain point, but integrates other ad-hoc stuff.

A Defi product offers devs simplified access to DeFi protocols. the proposal is to build a sort of SDK to allow simplified access to DeFi protocols, a one-to-many abstraction layer that interacts with smart contracts, sign transactions and sends/receives tokens to/from contracts.
