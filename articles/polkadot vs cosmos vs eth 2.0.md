# Blockchain 3.0:
Mainly focuses on:
1. Scalability
2. Isolatability
3. Developability
4. Governance
5. Applicability

## Section 1: Explaining these major factors
### Scalability

Scalability refers to the factor of how much extra scalable can the app be made with adding extra network capacity?
The scalability factor for a normal bitcoin protocol is zero. The transaction fees is extremely high.
In fact, wrt ethereum, it becomes even more difficult because of the gas required for the extra smart contract computations done on the ethereum network.

### Isolatability




## Section 2: General solutions to these problems and their implications

## Section 3: How the 3 major players are handling this?
