# Blockchain 3.0:
Mainly focuses on:
1. Scalability
2. Isolatability
3. Developability
4. Governance
5. Applicability

## Section 1: Explaining these major factors
### Understanding the basics:
#### Scalability

Scalability refers to the factor of how much extra scalable can the app be made with adding extra network capacity?
The scalability factor for a normal bitcoin protocol is zero. The transaction fees is extremely high.
In fact, wrt ethereum, it becomes even more difficult because of the gas required for the extra smart contract computations done on the ethereum network.

#### Isolatability

Or compatibility. This refers to how compatible the given blockchain is with customised applications written on top of the blockchains. The point is that a platform should be compatible for most things. Thus, for eg if we want to create minecraft, it is difficult to create it on ethereum as the computation price would be extremely high.

#### Developability

This refers to both the User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). For eg. a huge advantage of ethereum is that you don't need any infrastructure to host your projects. Simply create your project, and deploy it. It will start working on the ethereum blockchain. At times, smart contracts are not recommended, and might not even be safe. There can be hacks such as the DAO hack because of which eth split into two systems, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. 
So, the entire ecosystem depends upon a few factors. These are mainly:
1. How good is the ecosystem? Usage?
2. How good is the infrastructure? Usage?
3. How strong is the foundation of the platform?

#### Governance

The question is how governable is the blockchain platform? Many older projects lack it, while the newer projects prefer it. For eg. wrt bitcoin, there are 3 parties: miners, users and developers. Miners would want higher transaction costs to make money, while users would want lower transaction costs to use it regularly for transactions. If developers work on new features, they would want to implement it and need the others to come onboard. Ethereum is governed by Ethereum Foundation. The backing of a proper foundation behind a cryptocurrency means that there is a set direction for the project

#### Applicability

Being a great platform is a killer feature. Other projects automatically develop on top.

### Understanding the basics:
#### Scalability:

Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling. One problem with horizontal scaling wrt bitcoin is it is not  possible to scale by creating copies of bitcoin repos. Secondly, there are technical limits wrt vertical scaling. PoW and longest chain rule can be scaled up by increasing block size and reducing block time **theoritically**. Reducing the block time increases centralization in the entire bitcoin network.
Well, the new blockchains try to solve both the problems. They try solving vertical problem using PoS, while the horizontal scaling problem by supporting interactibility between the various blockchains. This is because unlike PoW, PoS doesn't need to solve a probabilistic puzzle.
