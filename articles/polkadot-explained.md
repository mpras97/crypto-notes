# Polkadot

## What are they?

Next-generation blockchain protocol that combines an entire network of purpose-built blockchains. Multi-chain framework platform that's designed to offer interoperability and scalability solutions for the blockchains built on it. Scalability and interoperability are two major problems in the space because:
1. Scalibility: Networks are bloated and slow. Realistically to reach throughput and efficiency required to reach global scale.
2. Interoperability: Blockchains operate in independent silos usually. Thus, a huge use case to allow them to interoperate.
3. Governance: Not a major issue for all cryptos. But polkadot has a strong governance system.

## Polkadot tech stack:
 Built on top of **substrate** blockchain network. The advantage of building on top of sustrate is the blockchains can communicate, transact and transfer data with other substrate based chains. These are sharded blockchains.
